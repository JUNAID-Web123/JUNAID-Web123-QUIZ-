# Here are some Python practice questions focusing on operations (arithmetic, logical, bitwise, etc.) to help you sharpen your skills:

# Arithmetic Operations

# Write a Python program to calculate the area of a circle given its radius. Use the formula: $$\text{Area} = \pi r^2$$.
# Create a program that takes two numbers as input and performs all basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and floor division).
# Write a function to calculate the compound interest using the formula:
# $$A = P(1 + r/n)^{nt}$$
# where:
# (P) = principal amount
# (r) = annual interest rate
# (n) = number of times interest is compounded per year
# (t) = time in years
# Logical Operations
# Write a program that checks if a given number is divisible by both 3 and 5 using logical operators.
# Create a function that takes three numbers as input and returns True if all three numbers are positive, otherwise False.
# Write a program to determine if a year is a leap year using logical conditions.
# Bitwise Operations
# Write a Python program to swap two numbers without using a temporary variable, using bitwise XOR.
# Create a function that takes an integer and returns its binary representation without using the bin() function.
# Write a program to check if a number is a power of 2 using bitwise operations.
# Assignment Operations
# Write a program that demonstrates the use of all assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=) with a single variable.
# Comparison Operations
# Write a function that compares two numbers and returns:
# "Equal" if they are the same
# "Greater" if the first number is larger
# "Smaller" if the first number is smaller
# Create a program that takes a list of numbers and finds the largest and smallest numbers using comparison operators.
# Mixed Operations
# Write a program to calculate the sum of squares of the first (n) natural numbers using a loop.
# Create a function that takes a string and checks if it is a palindrome (ignoring case and spaces).
# Write a program to simulate a simple calculator that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /, %) as input and performs the corresponding operation.

# These questions cover a range of difficulty levels and will help you practice Python operations effectively. Happy coding! 




# radius=float(input("enter the radius"))
# area =3.14*radius**2
# print(area)

# p=float(input("enter the p"))
# r=float(input("enter the r"))
# n=float(input("enter the n"))
# t=float(input("enter the t"))
# A=p*(1+r/n)**(n*t)
# print(A)/
